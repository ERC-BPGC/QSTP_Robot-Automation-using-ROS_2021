# Control Theory Resources

Refer [this](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/handbook/automation/ControlTheory/Control_Theory/) article from the ERC Handbook to get an introduction to what Control Theory is. It will also cover some fundamental concepts of control theory.

If you find yourself interested in the subject of control theory, these ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBc_BHxw78s&list=PLUMWjy5jgHK1NC52DXXrriwihVrYZKqjk), [2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)) video series by Brian Douglas and Steve Brunton are good comprehensive resources to get started with. Note that these playlists cover a large amount of material. For basic robotics, watching the introductory videos and understanding the basic concepts should be enough. However, feel free to use these as reference materials for future endeavours where you may need more advanced concepts to tackle your problems.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08pQBgjxYFXSsODEF3Jqmm-y) playlist by MathWorks is an excellent place to understand the working of the PID controller.

[This](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/handbook/automation/ControlTheory/PID_Controller/) is a quick guide covering the basics of PID controllers.

[This](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf) is a thorough guide on PID and includes how you can go about implementing it.

By the end of the week, you should -

1. Understand the dynamics of movement of the turtlebot - a differential drive bot
2. Be able to implement a simple PID controller for Turtlebot
