# Week 3

Welcome to Week 3. So far, you have set up your ROS development environment and learnt how to work with basic ROS and simulate Turtlebot in Gazebo. Now it's time to move on to the next aspect of controlling the movement of our robot: **Control Theory**.

The main aims for this week will are -

1. Get familiar with the basics of control theory
2. Understand how a differential drive robot works
3. Study the Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller, which you will also implement for the assignments.

*Note: Although control theory is a very vast subject, the reading material for this week will be relatively shorter than the previous weeks as we won't be needing a detailed study of the subject for the project.*

Refer [this](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/handbook/automation/ControlTheory/Control_Theory/) article from the ERC Handbook to get an introduction to what Control Theory is. It will also cover some fundamental concepts of control theory.

If you find yourself interested in the subject of control theory, these ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBc_BHxw78s&list=PLUMWjy5jgHK1NC52DXXrriwihVrYZKqjk), [2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)) video series by Brian Douglas and Steve Brunton are good comprehensive resources to get started with. Note that these playlists cover a large amount of material. For basic robotics, watching the introductory videos and understanding the basic concepts should be enough. However, feel free to use these as reference materials for future endeavours where you may need more advanced concepts to tackle your problems.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08pQBgjxYFXSsODEF3Jqmm-y) playlist by MathWorks is an excellent place to understand the working of the PID controller.

[This](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/handbook/automation/ControlTheory/PID_Controller/) is a quick guide covering the basics of PID controllers.

[This](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf) is a thorough guide on PID and includes how you can go about implementing it.

By the end of the week, you should -

1. Understand the dynamics of movement of the turtlebot - a differential drive bot
2. Be able to implement a simple PID controller for Turtlebot
