# Week 3

Welcome to Week 3. So far, you have set up your ROS development environment and learnt how to work with basic ROS and simulate Turtlebot in Gazebo. Now it's time to move on to the next aspect of controlling the movement of our robot: **Control Theory**.

The main aims for this week will are -

1. Get familiar with the basics of control theory
2. Understand how a differential drive robot works
3. Study the Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller, which you will also implement for the assignments.

*Note: Although control theory is a very vast subject, the reading material for this week will be relatively shorter than the previous weeks as we won't be needing a detailed study of the subject for the project.*

You can check out the resources for this week [here](https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/QSTP_Robot-Automation-using-ROS_2021/blob/main/WEEK%203/RESOURCES.md).
