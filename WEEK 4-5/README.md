# Week 4-5

For the coming few days, we will focus on learning a path tracking or path following algorithm. One of the most famous one is Pure-Pursuit, and we will be sticking to it for this project. 

As you know, our final project involves following another robot. Thus, we will not be using any 'path planning' algorithms you might have heard before (eg: RRT, PRM, A*, etc.)
