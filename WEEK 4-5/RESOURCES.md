# Pure Pursuit Resources

The resources for this week involve some videos and some articles. However, you are encouraged to study more about any particular aspect of the Pure Pursuit algorithm from any other resource available online.

First, to get an idea of what path following is, you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kGgohGMpfU) video.

You can read about the Pure Pursuit algorithm and its implementation [here](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub3/coulter_r_craig_1992_1/coulter_r_craig_1992_1.pdf). 

You can also watch these two videos:
1) [F1TENTH Pure Pursuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_FEKkeN_fg)
2) [Tutorial on Pure Pursuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYR7mmcwT2w)

Further, you can find three methods for lateral control of a robot in [this](https://dingyan89.medium.com/three-methods-of-vehicle-lateral-control-pure-pursuit-stanley-and-mpc-db8cc1d32081) article. We will *only* be concerned with the Pure Pursuit algorithm from it though. You can skip the others.
