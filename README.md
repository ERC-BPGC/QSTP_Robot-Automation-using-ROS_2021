# QSTP Robot Automation Using ROS

This repository contains all material from the Robot Automation using ROS summer course taught by [Srujan Deolasee](https://github.com/Srujan-D), [Suhrudh S](https://github.com/SuhrudhSarathy) and [Sushant Swamy](https://github.com/sushant1212), as part of the QSTP initiative. Automation and Control in Robotics is a fast growing field with exciting innovations coming out with a rapid pace (check out [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmNaLtC6vkU) & [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sBBaNYex3E)). In this course we hope to familiarise you with the basic tools and techniques that are at the core of such developments.

## Course Structure

The course begins from scratch by covering the basics of **Python** including branching, looping, basic I/O and functions. The key tool you will be learning in the course is the **Robotics Operating System (ROS)** - a software framework designed to make robotics development easier. Along with this you will also be working with **Gazebo** which is a robotics simulator where you can create your own robot models or even test out code on pre-existing [Turtlebot](https://www.turtlebot.com/).

The final project is programming an **autonomous ground robot**, this will involve combining the tasks you will do over the course of the 6 weeks.

## Software Requirements

We recommend that you try installing ROS before the beginning of the QSTP. We have also dedicated the first week to setup and installation so that we can troubleshoot any issues you may face. We will be putting up detailed instructions for the process on the QSTP repository. For those unable to set up Ubuntu for whatever reason, please put it up on the group or contact one of the team, we will try to work out some alternatives.

1. OS: Ubuntu 16.04 /18.04 /20.04 | Ubuntu on Virtual Machine (for Windows) | ROS Docker Image (for [MacOS](https://www.xiaokeyang.com/blog/using_ros_with_docker_in_macos) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/))
2. Software: [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (for Ubuntu 16.04) or [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (for Ubuntu 18.04) or [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (for Ubuntu 20.04)
3. Python 2.7+ (usually pre-installed with Ubuntu OS)
4. Useful Tools: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### What is QSTP?

Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) is a platform where experienced BITS students (currently in their 2/3/4th year); part of the clubs or independently; mentor Project-centric Courses for other students over the summer. This course functioned from 6th July to 20th August 2021.

Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) in association with GDG (Google Developers Group) & WTM (Women Techmakers) Goa is open for participation from all students irrespective of their branch and year of study.

Please check out the QSTP'21 website for details on each project and further information. https://qstp.bitsquark.org/
